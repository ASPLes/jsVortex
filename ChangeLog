	turbulence: * [fix] Updated turbulence engine to avoid failing when it is not   possible to setup set hard and soft socket limit.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path engine to defer profile
	  path decision when separate="yes", it is on-connect selection,
	  serverName on profile path is ".*" and the user didn't still provided
	  a serverName (because no BEEP session has been stablished yet). This
	  fixes those situations where a profile path with a serverName=".*"
	  catches all connections even though having other profile paths with
	  the right serverName (matching one). Added test_27 reg test to reproduce
	  the bug and check the fix introduced.

	turbulence: * [fix] Added additional regression test to check connections that must   be sent to child process but at <on connect> time: test_27. Still more   work required.

2013-04-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Making child process wait at the parent process to be skipped   when detected parent process is finishing..

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated child local socket path code run by parent process   to avoid calling to connect when the path doesn't exists...implemented   internal micro-waits to let the child to process until the parent is   able to connect.

	  errno != 0 and and raw read error was found.

	turbulence: * [fix] Added new regression test to properly check WebSocket with TLS   connections on child process. Used this to cleanup the module. Several   updates into the turbulence-process to allow fixing the serverName on   child (which is imposed by the WebSocket Host header).

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a new function to   return the internal data hash associated to each connection. API   added:
	  - vortex_connection_get_data_hash

	* [fix] Fixed some debug logs that should be critical at vortex
	  connection module.

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] Global engine update to allow supporting in a general   manner proxing BEEP connection on the master process so they   are handled transparently at the child process as if it were   received directly by them.
	  This new support has been added to bypass the limitations of
	  OpenSSL in terms to saving SSL context and recovering it at a
	  child process.

	  With this new support mod-websocket is able to work on master
	  and child processes (using reuse=yes configuration).
	  NICE!!! Still more work is required to update regression
	  tests and cleanup the code.

	  API added:
	  - turbulence_conn_mgr_proxy_on_parent

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Some missing additions..

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] Added initial working mod-webosocket version with support to handle   applications at the parent process. Still more work is required to allow   applications on children too. Now it is possible to reach applications served   by Turbulence via BEEP over WebSocket (ws:// and wss://). Nice!!   Updated regression test to include an initial test suite (test_25).
	* [fix] Making turbulence process to not activate SIGCHLD handler on master
	  process until a child is created.

	* [new] Updated Turbulence engine to allow configuring search domains (for
	  data applications) inside <system-paths> nodes as done until now inside
	  profile path declaration.

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Fix axl_node_get_content_trim to flag its result with   const char * (instead of just char *).

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making channel start notification to detect and fix serverName   value provided by the requestor in the case serverName value was already   configured on the BEEP session by a previous request.
	* [fix] Updated vortex-websocket extension library to setup the serverName
	  value associated to the BEEP session according to the Host header received
	  over the WebSocket connection (if provided). Also updated the module to
	  flag the connection as "having TLS on" when received a successful
	  TLS WebSocket connection (wss://). This way turbulence is able to handle
	  BEEP sessions with TLS profile and BEEP session over wss:// with the same
	  profile path declaration. Fixed vortex-websocket-1.1.pc to also require
	  nopoll module.

2013-03-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Added initial code to support mod-websocket (a module to provide   websocket services through libvortex-websocket-1.1).

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed documentation failure which was causing to get the exarg mainpage   instead of turbulence's. Added security clarification note to explain why it is   not required to add any connmark declaration when it comes to secure profiles   inside.

	turbulence: * [fix] Updated mod-tls to close the connection when TLS handshake fails   to avoid security implementations (even though they are covered). Now if   the user configures a close-on-failure="yes" or doesn't say anything about   that attribute, the connection will be closed.

2013-03-23  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Added new regression test to try to trick turbulence server   when requesting TLS (but it wasn't properly initiated).

	* [new] Added new functions to allow storing and getting a hook pointer
	  associated to a connection to avoid having to use vortex_connection_set_data
	  and its getters which its computational expensive in cases where lots of
	  calls are required. API added:

	  - vortex_connection_get_hook
	  - vortex_connection_set_hook

	* [fix] Updated reading code to track the number of "no data available" operations
	  found for a particular connection to shutdown it when a certain amount is
	  reached.

2012-05-28  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex sequencer sending code to first manage   channel 0 requests and then process the rest of connections. This is   done to ensure administrative channel is able to communicate channel   creation or removal before next request happens on those channels.   Until now, under some rare cases vortex was producing a protocol   violation because it was sending content before the remote peer   received the channel open RPY over the channel 0.
	* [fix] Updated vortex_async_queue_ref to return a boolean value
	  to signal the caller if reference operation finished properly.

	* [fix] Updated vortex thread pool activation to acquire a queue
	  reference directly from the activation object instead of getting
	  that reference from the pool. Fixes test-00e

2012-05-11  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Added new API to control more details about   the thread pool automatic resize. API added:
	   - vortex_thread_pool_setup2

	* [fix] Fixed internal automatic thread pool resize
	  code to check the thread add period to be bigger or
	  equal to (not just bigger) so threads are added when
	  the period is filled (not just filled + 1seg).

2012-05-09  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Updated mod-radmin status command to report more info about
	  run time server status.

	* [new] Updated mod-radmin to include a new command (show channels)
	  to show all channels running in all connections handled by the

	turbulence: * [new] Updated turbulence-ctl command to read current radmin.conf   file found inside /etc/turbulence/profile.d to detect declared   serverName so now it is possible to use a random serverName value   to better integrate with deployed profile paths. Also updated the   tool to detect if SASL is enabled (as declared inside radmin.conf)   so the tool directly start SASL before proceeding creating radmin-ctl   channel.
	* [new] Added new script that properly setup the radmin module, creating
	  all files and user databases. Script added:

	  - tbc-setup-mod-radmin.py

2012-01-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Several updates to remove clean start concept which   was providing more problems than solving them. Updated   base configuration and documentation to remove all references   to this concept. Checked regression tests and updated them   accordingly to reflect the change. This won't break   deployed/working configurations...

2012-01-30  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Debian/squeeze..

	* [fix] Debian/lenny updates..

	* [fix] Making Vortex.debug.js released to set singleFile to true.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex_channel_set_serialize to grab current next   seqno value when it is requested to enable serialize, to allow   enabling serialize operation even when it is enabled on a channel   with content transferred previously without such state. Bug exposed   by core-admin.

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed memory leak inside turbulence-conn-mgr module when   connections errors are showed.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updating debian/lenny

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated PyVortex channel API to allow configuring   frame complete flag and frame complete limit. API added:
	   - set_complete_flag
	   - set_complete_frame_limit

	turbulence: * [fix] Making python tests to be executed only if requested by   the tester. This is to avoid python poor support to init and   finalize several times the engine.

	turbulence: * [new] Updated turbulence module API to include a function that   allows configuring if a particular module should be unmapped when close.   Used this to avoid unmapping mod-python, which later gives problems if   it is loaded again into the same process. Updated regresssion test to   use this. API added:
	   - turbulence_module_skip_unmap

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Fixed turbulence reg tests to conform latest vortex   changes..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixed internal __vortex_channel_set_state to ensure turbulence   works with latests changes..

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] General engine update to provide an API for sending MSG,   RPY and ERR messages whose frames are all flagged with more flag   on. This allows to send a set of messages, that are then translated   into frames, where all of them belongs to the same MSG. API added:
	   - vortex_channel_send_msg_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_rpy_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_err_more

	  Added regression test (test_02-r) to reproduce use cases and check
	  that it is working. Added documentation explaining how to use this.


	* [new] Updated PyVortex API to provide an API to new opened send
	  operations (send_msg_more). API added:

	   - vortex.Channel.send_msg_more
	   - vortex.Channel.send_rpy_more
	   - vortex.Channel.send_err_more

	  Updated documentation.

	* [fix] Fixed BEEP checking engine for received frames to ensure it is
	  detected when a remote BEEP peer replies two times to a MSG frame whose
	  msgno is 0. Bug found during send_msg_more API development.

	* [fix] Fixed sending operations involving VortexPayloadFeeder objects that
	  were paused to check if their msgno is on the pending reply list to avoid
	  a race where pause operation happens at the same time the msgno is removed
	  from the list.

	* [fix] Fixed security bug where vortex engine may accept a fake RPY with
	  message number of 0, deliverying to user configured handler, even without
	  having sent a MSG frame with that number. Only happened with msgno 0.

2012-01-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Several updates into the core library to better log   errors that involves closing the connection. Now those errors   are logged into connection so they can be checked using already   available channel pop error API. Added new connection error   to identify connection closed by remote peer without going through   the BEEP close process.

	turbulence: * [fix] Making turbulence conn mgr to log errors found on   connections that are closed. Skipped typical errors to   avoid logging frequent errors (like connection closed by   remote peer, and similar).

	turbulence: * [new] Updated turbulence context handler to record a reference   to the context itself into the vortex context. Also added new macro   to get VortexCtx from TurbulenceCtx. API added:
	   - VORTEX_TBC_CTX

	* [fix] Closing release 0.5.2..

	* [fix] General update to produce a jsVortex bundle that includes   an unified Vortex.js without any debug statement   (Vortex.{log, error, warn}) and to also produce the same version   with all those statements called Vortex.debug.js. Updated source   code to standarize all calls to Vortex.log so they are done in   a single line.

	turbulence: * [fix] Closing release 0.5.5

	libaxl: * [fix] Closing 0.6.7 release..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Closing release 1.1.11

2011-12-30  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Fixed bug while splitting frames what uses   utf-8 codes that expands into 2 or 3 bytes when translated   to byte representation, causing not observing max allowed   bytes accepted by remote BEEP peer. Now the situation is   detected and the difference is removed so splitted piece   fits into the accepted window size. Added regression test   to reproduce the bug and check fix introduced.

2011-12-21  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixed API clash between debian/ubuntu and RHEL where SSL_CTX_new   and method created returns and receives const SSL_METHOD *. Updated the   code to avoid declaring variables with that type passing directly the   value returned from method creation into SSL_CTX_new. Bug reported by   Philip Black-Knight..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Phil Black-Knight reported and fixed a problem at   vortex_connection_set_profile_mask where the function was   always returning an error code for the first handler installed   (although it was indeed properly installed).
	* [fix] Removed code that checks for reference counting at internal
	  channel termination when detected pending messages to be sent
	  (new design doesn't requires this).

2011-12-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Committing changelog debian/squeeze/amd64

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Included file.sup into make dist result.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex ALIVE implementation to check vortex_channel_ref   result before continuing. Also making the implementation to grab the   reference before setting the channel used by the check loop (fixed   race exposed by PyVortex).
	* [fix] Fixed memory leak at PyVortex caused by a circular reference
	  built by vortex connection reference counting and python reference
	  counting. Added initial file.sup to better track all memory consumed
	  by PyVortex.

2011-12-13  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Moved debug log before connection registering at vortex_listener   module to avoid wrong mem. access under some cases..

2011-12-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [fix] Making mod-python turbulence.Ctx.broadcast_msg to not acquire   python GIL when called filter user function because it already owns   the GIL..

2011-12-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated internal channel add handler to report a boolean   value with the operation result so channel resources can be released   after a failure.
	* [fix] Making vortex pull cleanup to also clear event masks.

	* [fix] Making vortex thread pool to acquire the VortexCtx reference
	  before starting the pool thread (to avoid races where thread isn't
	  still started and VortexCtx was finished when having skip thread pool
	  wait flag enabled).

2011-12-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Changelog updates..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex.Ctx.new_event to flag event period   with "l" instead of "i" to avoid OverflowError: signed   integer is greater than maximum.

	  PyVortexChannel reference as a parameter to the frame received handler
	  to avoid a crash when the frame received is fired having the python
	  channel collected (but not its C representation).

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	turbulence: * [new] General engine update to allow creating a BEEP connection between parent   and childs created. This connection is generic (is a BEEP connection!) and at   this moment is being used by mod-radmin to implement turbulence management and   status notification. GREAT!
	  Added turbulence regression test to check connection creation and its status:
	  test_10-b.

	* [new] Added first fully working/checked mod-radmin and turbulence-ctl tool that
	  allows getting real-time state for a running turbulence process. For now, the
	  tandem supports:

	    - showing connections on master parent and all childs
	    - showing all childs
	    - getting turbulence process status
	    - killing childs and connections (on master and childs process: nice!!).

	* [fix] General engine work to ensure regression tests releases all parent memory
	  at child process to allow easy memory leak and proper memory access using valgrind.
	  Until know there where too many errors to make valgrind reports to be usable.
	  Fixed many bugs and memory wrong access (and some leaks ;-).

	* [new] Added new module to handle turbulence child process object (and related
	  elements). API added:

	  - turbulence_child_new
	  - turbulence_child_ref
	  - turbulence_child_unref

	* [fix] General update at the turbulence context module to acquire a reference to
	  the vortex ctx object associated and to release it at the very end. Updated API
	  to include a method that allows checking if the current turbulence context is
	  associated (or it is) a child. API added:

	   - turbulence_ctx_is_child

	* [fix] Updated turbulence finalization to do module cleanup at the very last step
	  to allow module code to be available until the end of the turbulence context.
	  Also updated the code to not release vortex context associated when it is detected
	  not enough references (which shows wrong module/turbulence engine programming) but
	  instead of breaking, drop an error log.

	* [fix] Several updates on turbulence conn mgr module to avoid using state object
	  and to start using TurbulenceCtx as a step before getting such object which is
	  more safe (fixes memory wrong access and some races showed by valgrind).

	* [fix] Updated mod-sasl to allow loading extension.modules file from "sasl" domain
	  context defined (vortex_support_domain_find_data_file). Also updated the module
	  to release mod_msyql_sasl dtd on close.

	* [fix] Making mod-python to detect if some python app was loaded at the parent
	  (causing the python engine to be initialized as well) to avoid starting on child process.
	  There is no way to make python to work after a fork without an execve operation.
	  Instead of breaking misteriously, making the module to refuse loading giving a
	  concrete error message.

	* [fix] Reorganized mod-python loading code to load site and sytem config files
	  before initializing python (to avoid problems at the childs).

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex listener API to allow creating a BEEP listener   without registering the object created into the vortex reader. API added:
	   - vortex_listener_new_full2

	* [fix] Making vortex_sequencer_drop_connection_messages to also check
	  for connection exit status to avoid iterating over internal sequencer
	  structures releasing connection pending messages.

	* [fix] Updated channel added/removed notification, inside vortex connection
	  module, to release and re-acquire mutex before jumping into user handler. Added
	  code to get safe references to handlers that will be called to avoid races.

	* [fix] Updated vortex internal data tracking to also record bytes sent. Also
	  fixed missed tracking for bytes received at readline functions (BEEP header).

	* [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a method that allows removing
	  keys/valus installed with vortex_connection_set_data/data_full wihtout calling
	  registered destroy functions. API added:

	   - vortex_connection_delete_key_data

	* [new] Updated thread API to include a function that return current reference
	  counting state for a VortexAsyncQueue. API added:

	  - vortex_async_queue_ref_count

	* [fix] Updated channel wait reply code to detect connection close when the
	  synchrnous wait is started.

	* [new] Updated vortex API to include a function that allows checking if
	  current vortex context is finishing. API added:

	  - vortex_is_exiting

	* [new] Updated vortex Ctx API to include a function that allows getting
	  current reference counting state. Added internal check to avoid running
	  dealloc operation when ref count bellow or equal to 0 is detected. API
	  added:

	  - vortex_ctx_ref_count

	* [fix] Fixed vortex_hash_remove which was calling to remove twice. ???

	* [fix] Updated vortex listener on accepted handler to acquire references to
	  handlers about being executed before releasing lock.

	* [fix] Making vortex listener module to acquire a reference to the listener
	  that created the new connection so the function vortex_connection_get_listener
	  returns a valid reference.

	* [fix] Updated PyVortexCtx object to support an attribute that returns current
	  reference counting. API added:

	  - vortex.Ctx.ref_count

	* [fix] Updated PyVortexCtx module to stop firing vortex events into python user
	  code when it is detected vortex is finishing.

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Added convenient function alias called axl_list_foreach, that   wraps axl_list_lookup, allowing to write code that looks what is   done. Added documentation to explain its use. API added:
	   - axl_list_foreach

	* [fix] Making axl_hash_remove internals to decrease number of items the hash
	  has before calling key/value destroy so those functions gets updated
	  status.

	  vortex sequencer to drop pending packages when a vortex context
	  exit is in place.

	* [fix] Making vortex_channel_new to acquire an internal reference to the
	  channel created to avoid races between this function and the on created
	  handler. Checked in test_16 alive reg test. Making also to acquire a
	  reference to the connection during the creation process.

	* [fix] Making vortex thread pool to acquire independent references to
	  func and user data pointers to allow releasing internal mutexes during
	  user code invocation. Making thread pool module to skip user code
	  invocation in a vortex exit is in place.

	* [fix] General updates to vortex alive module to decouple channel creation
	  from the alive check itself to avoid races that may cause the alive check
	  to monopolize (which was integrating channel creation) resources. Fixed
	  several wrong access. Many thanks to DEXTER which provided a patch that
	  fixed several bugs in the initial code (wrong reply using msg, wrong
	  outstanding messages check, missing user failure handler configuration).

Now all operations   are done against opened profiles on a connection (not channels) which   improve operations where 1000 channels may be opened but only 3 profiles   are running.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path module to allow application layer
	  to install a profile alias that causes to check a certain attribute
	  on a connection instead of the profile itself. This is useful for
	  TLS profile because once it finishes, there is no TLS channel to check.
	  API added:

	   - turbulence_ppath_add_profile_attr_alias

	  paths.

	* [fix] Updated turbulence process module to check if exists the run time
	  directory used to create the child control socket. The module creates it
	  in the case it is not available.

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex_connection_set_channel_removed_handler and   vortex_connection_set_channel_added_handler to return an unique   reference to the installed handler which allows to remove it   later. API added:
	   - vortex_connection_remove_handler

	* [fix] Change added channel notification at server side to be
	  done before doing the RPY to avoid race conditions.

	* [fix] Fixed memory leak at vortex_support_add_domain_search_path_ref
	  which was causing to lost memory references in the case the path
	  was already added.

Reg tests showed bugs on axl hash implementation and its capacity to   properly retain internal nodes (causing linear memory consumption in   long running applications).

2010-02-16  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [new] Updated axl factory internals to implement optional spares   support allowing to reuse nodes released (returned to the factory)   which can be used later by next calls to axl_factory_get. API added:
	   - axl_factory_release_spare
	   - axl_factory_spare_max
	   - axl_factory_spare_next

	* [fix] Updated axlHash implementation to use new spare support from
	  factory that allows reusing internal hash nodes, saving memory allocations
	  in common insert/remove cycles (specially using same keys). Updated
	  regression tests to check function and how it saves space (test_02_04_1).
	  Initial results shows a total amount of bytes allocated of 20,300 that
	  now consumes 389 in a constant manner (assuming insert and removes
	  keeps the hash under the same set of items).

2010-02-11  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	af-arch: * [fix] Version updates..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Committing missing .def files and VERSION.

2010-02-11  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex channel send MSG support to allow limitting how   many outstanding messages can be hold until the caller is locked until   some replies come in. This allow to limit memory consuption by avoiding   storing messages until they can be sent. Updated vortex channel API   to include a couple of functions that allows to configure such limit and   to get current outstanding message queue length:
	   - vortex_channel_set_outstanding_limit
	   - vortex_channel_get_outstanding_messages
