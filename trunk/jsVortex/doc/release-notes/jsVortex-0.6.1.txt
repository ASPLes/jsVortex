>>>> This release in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Added BEEP over WebSocket support ;-) 

  - Improved library partial frame header handling and retry code when
    the connection isn't available.

  - Several improvements and bug were fixed.


>>>> Changes from last release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* [fix] Making VortexBase64.{encode,decode} to just return when they
  receive null or undefined.

* [fix] Making VortexBase64.{encode,decode} to return the same object
  if received a hash or a list.

* [fix] Several modifications to support BEEP over WebSocket using
  recent noPoll support added to Vortex Library. Updated regression
  tests to check all items are passed. Nice!!!

* [fix] Fixed some wrong variable references when WebSocket connection
  fails.

* [fix] Several fixings into reg test and WebSocket send handler to
  make it to work with Firefox...poor performance got with this
  browser compared with GG. They must catch up!

* [fix] Updated frame reading engine to detect missing header trailing
  \r\n not as a failure but instead saving read content waiting for
  more octets to come to complete the operation (but with a limit to
  avoid infinite header size).

* [fix] More changes to detect where was done the last header read
  inside the reading engine.

* [fix] More adjustments to support reading BEEP frames with partial
  headers..

* [fix] Fixed bug while reading several consolidated frames but where
  the last frame received in just a part of the header. Added code to
  save those bytes and retry later.

* [fix] Fixed support to receive incomplete BEEP frames and to retry
  later with safety.

* [fix] Adding more debug information when found frame join failures.

* [fix] Making internal frame getter to return the current list of frames
  found when found not enough content to be keep on processing frames instead
  of returning null.

* [fix] Some changes to detect frame seqno mismatch.

* [fix] More updates into the frame reading engine.
