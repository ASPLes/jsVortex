>>>> This release in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  New stable release that includes some fixings and a new building
  process that allows delivering a release version (without any debug
  statement) and a debug version (that includes them).

>>>> Changes from last release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* [fix] Adding documentation explaining how to solve "error calling
  method on npobject"..

* [fix] Added an additional common error explaining how to fix the
  problem on MAC OS/X when the java applet is not loaded.

* [fix] Fixed bug while splitting frames that uses utf-8 codes which
  expands into 2 or 3 bytes when translated to byte representation,
  causing not observing max allowed bytes accepted by remote BEEP
  peer. Now the situation is detected and the difference is removed so
  splitted piece fits into the accepted window size. Added regression
  test to reproduce the bug and check fix introduced.

* [fix] Moved onFrameReceivedHandler configuration inside
  channel.sendCommon out of the isComplete condition to avoid races.

* [fix] General update to produce a jsVortex bundle that includes an
  unified Vortex.js without any debug statement (Vortex.{log, error,
  warn}) and to also produce the same version with all those
  statements called Vortex.debug.js. Updated source code to standardize
  all calls to Vortex.log so they are done in a single line.
