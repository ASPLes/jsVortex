  --== jsVortex : Javascript BEEP implementation ==--

--== Intro ==--

See http://www.aspl.es/jsVortex for more documentation, API and
examples.

--== This package contains... ==--

Inside the zip bundle you'll find the following files:

  - Vortex.js : which includes the BEEP javascript implementation (all
    sources compressed into a single file for fast loading). See SVN
    source code for full code access.

  - Vortex.debug.js : which includes the same as Vortex.js but with
    additional debugging log to track down problems.

  - JavaSocketConnector.js : a javascript wrapper to aid Vortex.js to
    access JavaSocketConnector.jar

  - JavaSocketConnector.jar : a minimal java code required to access
    in a portable form to the socket API so BEEP can function.

--== How to use it ==--

1) Inside your web application, place the following declarations to
load the javascript part:

  <!-- include jsVortex files -->
  <script src="/path/to/files/Vortex.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

  <!-- include JavaSocketConnector files -->
  <script src="/path/to/files/JavaSocketConnector.js"></script>

2) Then add the following to load the java applet inside the <body>
declaration (for example, at the begining):

  <!-- load the connector applet -->
  <applet id="JavaSocketConnector" archive="/path/to/files/JavaSocketConnector.jar" code="JavaSocketConnector.class" width="0" height="0" MAYSCRIPT></applet>

3) Then ensure you have support for java in your brower. See
http://www.java.com.

--== Supported platforms ==--

Current, these are the browsers supported: Firefox 2, Firefox 3,
Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Google Chrome.
