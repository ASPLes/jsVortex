  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce jsVortex

  implementation.

  jsVortex is a Javascript BEEP implementation that is specially
  designed to run in the context of a web browser, turning it into an
  effective BEEP peer without too much effort.

>>>> This release in short
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed support for latest Java Applet releases (version 7). Fixed byte
length verification when broken (split in the wrong place) utf-8
content is received. 


>>>> Changes from last release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* [fix] Making make-zip.sh to setup right permissions for the package.

* [fix] Making getAcceptedIssuers inside JSCTrustManager to return
  null instead of an exception as done until now. It seems latest java
  versions are calling to this method (they wasn't doing that
  before)..

* [fix] Fixed bytelength content verification on frame received.
  Fixes rare cases where utf-8 content is received broken across
  several frames making VortexEngine.byteLength to fail to provide a
  right content length value.

* [fix] Moved to the public API VortexChannel.windowSize parameter.

* [fix] Updated channel lastMsgNoReply flag when an ERR or NUL frame
  is received (not only RPY). Opps..;-)

* [fix] Making Vortex.debug.js released to set singleFile to true.

* [fix] Fixed make-zip.sh to turn on singleFile when producing bundle.
