* [fix] Add regression test to check how behaves and if we receieve
  an error when we connect to an unknown host.

* [fix] Properly implement BEEP session close.

* [fix] Investigate cross domain policy restrictions. The following is
  used by flash socket to limit connections to be done only to a list 
  of allowed domains:

   <cross-domain-policy> 
      <site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="all"/>
      <allow-access-from domain="*" to-ports="9090,777"/> 
   </cross-domain-policy> 

   Think that a webpage with jsVortex can virtually connect to any site
   easily and setup an attack by making a user to post a message that
   could ask the user browser to do so. A simple solution is the previous
   example.
